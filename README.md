# NatlParkNow 

NatlParkNow is an web application that combines the National Park Service API and the Twitter API to curate the most recent twitter images for each US National Park.

I used Sequelize and PostgreSQL to create the database, PassportJS for authentication and Node.js, Express and Pug.js.
